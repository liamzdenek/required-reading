# Required Reading

This is my list of the most significant writings with regard to my worldview, which is a mix of engineering and philosophy. "Writing" is defined loosely as any multimedia.

I present this list in the order you should consume them in. Do not interpret the order as a value judgement (= the most important articles are not necessarily first.)

I've bisected this list into two lists, the 'essential' list and the 'supplemental' list. I ask that you do not skip items from the essential list, but you may skip items from the supplemental list.
